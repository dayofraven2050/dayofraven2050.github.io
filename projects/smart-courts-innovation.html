          <h2>Abstract</h2>
          <p>
            The rule-of-law business environment has increasingly merged with digital technologies via smart court construction.
            Leveraging the Supreme People’s Court Smart Court Construction Evaluation Index and a panel of Shanghai and Shenzhen A-share
            companies between 2018 and 2023, this study investigates how the digital rule-of-law environment alters corporate innovation behaviour.
          </p>
          <p>
            Results show that smart court development significantly boosts innovation, primarily through easing financing constraints and elevating managerial
            innovation willingness. The uplift is stronger for firms in economically underdeveloped regions, organisations hit by COVID-19 disruptions,
            companies facing higher tax uncertainty, and those at earlier stages of digital transformation. These findings extend the understanding of how
            institutional digitalisation shapes firm-level innovation, offering guidance for governments upgrading digital governance and for enterprises responding
            to the evolving judiciary landscape.

          <h2>Mechanisms &amp; Findings</h2>
          <ul>
            <li>Smart court construction alleviates corporate financing constraints and heightens managerial willingness to invest in innovation.</li>
            <li>The policy impact intensifies for firms located in less-developed regions, for enterprises exposed to COVID-19 shocks, and for those operating under higher tax uncertainty.</li>
            <li>Digital laggards benefit the most: firms with lower baseline digital transformation show the largest innovation acceleration.</li>
            <li>Findings broaden the evidence base on how digital rule-of-law reforms cascade into firm-level innovation outcomes and policy levers.</li>
          </ul>
